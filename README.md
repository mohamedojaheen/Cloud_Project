# Dockerized Web Application with MySQL Database

This is my Cloud Computing project and this repositry contains a Dockerized web application that utilizes MySQL for data storage. It includes two containers: one for the MySQL database and another for serving HTML content. The web application fetches data from the MySQL database and displays it on a web page.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have Docker installed on your system.
